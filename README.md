# Mush
 Repository for the 'Mush' mod.

## (Temporary Wiki below)

 - To start you need to find an Ash tree. These are found in snowy biomes.
 - Once you have collected at least 5 ash logs, you can craft a Sled. This is created with x1 chest, x2 ash logs, x4 sticks.
 - Next, you will need to find a village and craft a Dog Bowl. A dog bowl is created with x3 iron ingots and x1 bowl.
 - Once crafted, place it down in the village. A villager will then be able to become a Musher, using the dog bowl as a workstation.
 - Once you have unlocked enough trades with the Musher, you should be able to purchase a Wolf Harness. (This is the only way to obtain a wolf harness.)
 - Tame some wolves and right click them with the wolf harness. This will equip them with the harness.
 - You can now place down the sled. To add wolves to the sled, first leash a wolf and then right click the sled while holding a lead. This will attach the wolf to the sled. To add more wolves to the sled, leash a wolf and right click the wolf in the front of the sled while holding a lead. You can repeat this until you have reached a maximum of 4 wolves. Each wolf increases the speed of the sled.
 - To control the sled, right click the sled to ride it. Then use a and d to point the front most wolf. Using w will make the wolf run forward. The other wolves will follow the front most wolf in a train, all of them pulling your sled!
 - To detach wolves, shift right click them. This will remove their leads. Shift right click them again to remove their harness.

## (For the competition)

 - I do have a WIP biome which I have been unsuccessful at finding organically, however it works if you use the Single Biome world option. It is called Snowy Plains, however in the world option screen it is mush:snow_plains.
 - I attempted and failed to add a structure in time for the competition. I intend to figure out how and add it later on in this mod's development. It is called a Villager Camp. It would have been found in the Snowy Plains biome and would be made up of tents and other camp related things. This is where you would have organically found a Musher villager and potentially wolf harnesses as a loot item from chests.
 - Sleds in their current state do not have a chest inventory. I will add this in future versions.
